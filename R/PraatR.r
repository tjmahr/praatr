# praat() function #
####################

praat = function( # Begin argument list

# [1]
command,
# A character string indicating what command should be executed
# This will be checked against the 'SupportedCommands' database, and if it's not found there, an error message will be issued.

# [2]
arguments,
# A list() of arguments.
# This data structure is used because it is possible to mix of various classes, e.g. list("character", 12.34, 5, TRUE) 

# [3]
input,
# The (ideally full) path to the input file.

# [4]
output,
# The (ideally full) path to the output file.

# [5]
overwrite,
# Only applicable if the user chooses a 'Create' or 'Modify' command. (If they choose a 'Query' command, this will be ignored.)
# This indicates whether the command should be executed if the file specified in 'output' already exists (thereby overwriting it).
# By defaulting to FALSE, the user is protected from accidentally erasing data.
# It is very easy to turn this off, and the user feels like they have more control if they do.

# [6]
filetype,
# Only applicable if the user chooses a 'Create' or 'Modify' command.
# Determines what file format the output text file will have
# Three choices:
# "text"   = Save as text file...
# "short"  = Save as short text file...
# "binary" = Save as binary file...

# [7]
simplify
# Only applicable if the user chooses a 'Query' command.
# Determines whether the queried information will be coerced to numeric (i.e. just the core data) rather than remain as a text string (potentially along with various kinds of embellishing explanatory information).
# Either way, the result will (initially) be brought into R as a character string.
# The user specifies this as TRUE or FALSE. This later gets translated into 1 or 0 when passed to Praat.

){ # Begin actual body of function

####################
# VALIDATE COMMAND #
####################

# First check whether the command is one of the official list of supported ones
# (Note that, at present, this does not take into account the object type, and only considers the command itself.)

#############################
# CLASSIFY SUPPLIED COMMAND #
#############################

# Generally speaking, there is a one-to-one mapping between CommandNames and CommandTypes.
# Within the current set of supported commands, there are three exceptions.
# (1) The command 'Rotate...' is of type 'Modify' for a Configuration or Polygon object but of type 'Create' for a Permutation object.
# (2-3) The commands 'Filter (pass Hann band)...' and 'Filter (stop Hann band)...' are of type 'Modify' for a Spectrum object but of type 'Create' for a Sound object.
# Fortunately, these conflations do not involve queries.
# Thus, I can safely assume that randomly sampling one of the two in these ambiguous cases will not obscure the [+/-query] distinction.
# (I checked and everything I say above doesn't change based on the inclusion of 'Play' commands.)

RowIndex = which( command == SupportedCommands$CommandName )[1]
# For the three commands mentioned above, this will arbitrarily choose whichever comes first in terms of the ordering of the rows in the dataframe.

CommandType = as.character( SupportedCommands[RowIndex,"CommandType"] )
# At present, only three types are supported: Create, Modify, and Query.
